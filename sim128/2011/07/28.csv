Jul 28 02:11:25,2,3,"that you, yorkeiser?"
Jul 28 02:11:52,3,10,alliance actually - im joining to a public stop
Jul 28 02:12:25,3,10,i saw ur saturated message- u can get rid of it - im currently looking at power options
Jul 28 02:12:35,2,3,"ok, we need to do something with York Car Plant very soon"
Jul 28 02:13:09,3,10,what's the problem?
Jul 28 02:13:18,3,10,uve got 7000 cars waiting at ur yard
Jul 28 02:13:42,2,3,"yes, 12 hours ago there were 15000"
Jul 28 02:14:14,2,3,it's not that simple
Jul 28 02:15:17,3,10,i think we operate on different principles - i dont get how u can have 88000 iron waiting for one station lol it's just crazy
Jul 28 02:15:44,2,3,i am not here 24 hours a day
Jul 28 02:16:37,2,3,"it doesn't matter how we operate, but if we interfere with other players' lines we can cause major problems, like you did at Adinburgh"
Jul 28 02:16:48,2,3,*Edinburgh
Jul 28 02:17:56,2,3,"when you put your airport in, Finn's trucks stopped loading, which caused gridlock, GAC had to dismantle his bus network and put a subway in"
Jul 28 02:18:08,3,10,hang on - u added stuff to edinburgh too
Jul 28 02:18:16,3,10,the jam was there before i added airport
Jul 28 02:18:49,3,10,no plasitc was coming in - so i added plastic
Jul 28 02:18:51,2,3,"i added stuff to clear the jam, your airport took all the goods so the jam didn't clear until i deleted some roadas"
Jul 28 02:19:33,2,3,the problem was you took goods out
Jul 28 02:19:55,2,3,"adding plastic would not cause problems at the factory, it would cause them at the supplying refineries"
Jul 28 02:19:59,3,10,no goods were getting out - it was a complete jam before i added
Jul 28 02:20:28,2,3,no goods were getting out because the inputs weren't getting in
Jul 28 02:20:44,2,3,"once the inputs were supplied, production started"
Jul 28 02:21:11,2,3,but all the goods went on your planes because of how simutrans calculates
Jul 28 02:22:21,2,3,in a multiplayer game you have to remember that any problem you see is probably temporary
Jul 28 02:22:36,3,10,that problem was there for 5 years when i was playing
Jul 28 02:22:55,2,3,it is still temporary
Jul 28 02:22:59,3,10,i couldnt move finns trucks or GAC buses - it was absolute gridlock
Jul 28 02:23:18,2,3,"we think that player is not coming back, in that case we contact the host and the player gets deleted"
Jul 28 02:23:23,3,10,finn was in negative-so by moving the goods along - he still got profit back on steel train
Jul 28 02:23:52,2,3,"ah, if you had let him go bankrupt he and his infrastructure would have disappeared and solved the problem"
Jul 28 02:23:56,3,10,thought i was helping him out
Jul 28 02:24:16,3,10,well IF - i couldnt tell if he was coming back - and bankrupting someone is a bit rude
Jul 28 02:24:22,2,3,when a player goes bankrupt everything they built disappears
Jul 28 02:24:39,2,3,"never think that you are helping someone out without asking them first, you don't know what they are planning"
Jul 28 02:24:41,3,10,IF - i know that- but its rude bankrupting someone if they're going to come back
Jul 28 02:25:10,2,3,it is much more rude to duplicate someone else's lines
Jul 28 02:25:25,2,3,if someone doesn't come back that is their problem
Jul 28 02:25:53,2,3,and if their network is left to rot it causes more problems for those who are still in the game
Jul 28 02:26:24,2,3,we have lots of jams now from Finn's trucks all over the map
Jul 28 02:26:48,3,10,ah ok i didnt realise
Jul 28 02:27:09,2,3,"now to the issue at York, there are two things there"

Jul 28 02:28:04,0,255,Right now 2 clients are connected.
Jul 28 02:28:31,2,3,first i will explain a bit how my network operates
Jul 28 02:28:35,0,255,Right now 1 clients are connected.
Jul 28 02:28:57,0,255,Right now 2 clients are connected.
Jul 28 02:29:26,2,3,"i have 4 major hubs, each with a large rail yard"
Jul 28 02:29:42,2,3,99% of what i move goes thru at least one of these
Jul 28 02:29:49,3,10,ok i have noticed these huge hubs
Jul 28 02:30:04,2,3,so it may not be obvious what is connected to what
Jul 28 02:30:17,2,3,this is how most large transport companies work
Jul 28 02:30:26,2,3,esp the postal system
Jul 28 02:30:47,3,10,ok yes i must say trying to track ur network lost me :P mind u - u built it
Jul 28 02:31:01,2,3,"i can get major buildups of stock at hubs and ports, but it doesn't cause me any trouble"
Jul 28 02:31:23,2,3,once you understand the hub and spoke idea it's not so hard
Jul 28 02:31:40,2,3,it is simpler to operate a large network this way
Jul 28 02:32:16,2,3,so at York i move cars to Ely Yard by truck
Jul 28 02:32:26,3,10,ah for PAX i use hubs - for Freight i normally go direct-so ill try to grasp that idea
Jul 28 02:32:36,2,3,and then by truck from Ely Yard to Carlisle Dealership
Jul 28 02:33:10,2,3,i also rail textiles from Inverness Textile Mill - underground - and truck them to Carlisle Shopping Mall
Jul 28 02:33:17,3,10,everytime i looked at the dealership it was empty and thought uw ere transporting to the shopping mall and facotires nearby
Jul 28 02:33:46,2,3,the hub and spoke works well in simutrans because every producer has multiple customers and suppliers
Jul 28 02:34:13,2,3,"well, i hadn't put enough trucks on, i was adding them gradually so i wouldn't have too many"
Jul 28 02:34:42,3,10,ah ok
Jul 28 02:34:43,2,3,"again, don't second guess what others are doing, we don't all think the same way"
Jul 28 02:35:17,2,3,"if you see an overflow from another player, don't see it as something you can raid"
Jul 28 02:35:25,2,3,mention it to them and offer to helop
Jul 28 02:35:31,2,3,*help
Jul 28 02:36:10,2,3,"like you have built rail to Chester Gas Station, but i normally have that saturated"
Jul 28 02:36:23,2,3,"my refinery just ran out of oil while i was gone, that's all"
Jul 28 02:36:52,3,10,i dont remember u supplyingi t before? i only saw red and ur factories southof city
Jul 28 02:37:06,2,3,i supply it underground
Jul 28 02:37:12,2,3,Shift + u
Jul 28 02:37:27,3,10,ohh
Jul 28 02:37:43,2,3,"but there is a clue above ground, you can see my yellow Chester North Gas Station yard"
Jul 28 02:38:03,2,3,you can also click on the gas station and see what stops it connects to
Jul 28 02:38:30,2,3,and you can click on any yard and see what lines serve it
Jul 28 02:39:02,2,3,"i try to avoid blocking GAC's buses with my trucks, so i go underground in places"
Jul 28 02:39:33,3,10,i see
Jul 28 02:39:54,3,10,ill delete the railway next time so u can rmove ur sign
Jul 28 02:40:18,2,3,move my sign?
Jul 28 02:40:31,3,10,remove*
Jul 28 02:40:38,3,10,the saturated one
Jul 28 02:40:51,2,3,"i just deleted it, don't need it any more :)"
Jul 28 02:41:08,2,3,but your railway may not make any money
Jul 28 02:41:16,3,10,ive already deleted the convoy on the railway
Jul 28 02:41:54,2,3,at york it would suit me if you took all the product i am sending to Carlisle
Jul 28 02:42:15,2,3,"i am using trucks, you have a railway"
Jul 28 02:42:41,3,10,i didnt even notice u had made underground road at carlisle
Jul 28 02:42:54,2,3,but i can't stop trucking stuff unless you are railing it
Jul 28 02:43:19,2,3,"i only built that last night due to major traffic jams, i have 36 trucks going there"
Jul 28 02:43:41,3,10,yeah i saw that purple mess
Jul 28 02:44:20,2,3,"i figure you would like to take all the cars to Carlisle, that suits me"
Jul 28 02:44:30,2,3,if that suits you i will stop trucking away from the plant
Jul 28 02:44:58,3,10,yes please-if that's ok? im sorry for duplicating-like i said i didnt realise at first until u told me-ur call-
Jul 28 02:45:15,2,3,"well it suits me, if you had asked me i would have said yes"
Jul 28 02:45:40,2,3,next question is if you also want to take the textiles from inverness mill to carlisle shopping mall
Jul 28 02:46:31,2,3,i can deliver them to a public yard or you can build to there (i have an underground rail yard there)
Jul 28 02:47:09,2,3,"61,227"
Jul 28 02:47:30,3,10,oh it's fine - im doing textiles elsewhere so im focussing on that
Jul 28 02:48:01,2,3,well it's a way of making more money out of your railway
Jul 28 02:48:59,2,3,if you have spare capacity on your rail line it will make you money easily
Jul 28 02:49:15,2,3,this is where your planning comes in :)
Jul 28 02:49:31,2,3,i have now stopped taking trucks from york car plant
Jul 28 02:49:54,3,10,ill worry about it next time - since i gtg soon anyways  - u can keep textiles for now
Jul 28 02:50:23,2,3,"ok, let me know if you want them"
Jul 28 02:50:44,2,3,if you have any ideas for expansion talk to GAC & me as we can maybe help
Jul 28 02:51:02,2,3,GAC and I just got into the printing business together
Jul 28 02:51:27,3,10,oh ok
Jul 28 02:52:14,2,3,in the meantime perhaps we should send Finn bankrupt ASAP
Jul 28 02:53:43,2,3,"also, i will resume railing some cars from york plant in future, to supply Ely Dealership, but first i will deplete my stock from Ely Yard"
Jul 28 02:55:48,2,3,*trucking some cars
Jul 28 02:55:50,3,10,ok why not invest in power to the Ely Dealership?
Jul 28 02:56:27,2,3,"GAC is keen on building a power grid, i will ask him to do it"
Jul 28 02:56:40,3,10,ok
Jul 28 02:57:44,3,10,didnt realise how big some of the public interchanges where- extending underground
Jul 28 02:58:25,2,3,"i had nothing to do with them, you'll have to ask GAC and yorkeiser how they did it"
Jul 28 02:59:18,2,3,when they first connected their networks together GAC had 3 million passengers waiting
Jul 28 02:59:36,3,10,wow!
Jul 28 03:00:02,2,3,you joined soon after that and started taking some of GAC's passengers while he was still trying to plan what to do

Jul 28 03:01:14,3,10,ah he let me have those cities - i was just trying to help with excess
Jul 28 03:01:22,2,3,that was later
Jul 28 03:01:39,2,3,"like i said before, make contact, don't just start building"
Jul 28 03:02:57,2,3,if everyone in the game is trying to freeze you out then go to the forum and mention it there
Jul 28 03:03:08,2,3,but most people here are not like that
Jul 28 03:03:28,2,3,and the guys hosting the servers want co-operative friendly play
Jul 28 03:04:34,3,10,ok removed train line from chester

Jul 28 11:07:23,2,3,lucky simutrans drivers all have GPS
Jul 28 11:07:32,3,4,hehe
Jul 28 11:07:49,2,3,can i make a suggestion for the printing factory at Winchester?
Jul 28 11:08:00,3,4,But not for cars queuing in factories...
Jul 28 11:08:12,3,4,"yes, don't ask "
Jul 28 11:08:19,2,3,"yes, they do not know how to program their GPS"
Jul 28 11:08:24,3,4,;)
Jul 28 11:08:57,2,3,i suggest you make a small distribution hub at Winchester shopping centre
Jul 28 11:09:20,2,3,run just a few trucks between the printing factory and the hub
Jul 28 11:09:29,3,4,and no direct line to preston ? good idea
Jul 28 11:09:31,2,3,and truck from the hub to Preston shopping centre
Jul 28 11:09:46,3,4,ok I do it
Jul 28 11:09:53,2,3,and then you can take the output of your furniture factory thru there too
Jul 28 11:10:05,2,3,"from 18,85"
Jul 28 11:10:26,2,3,both goods can ride in same trucks
Jul 28 11:10:43,3,4,hehe good idea thanks a lot
Jul 28 11:10:58,2,3,this way you can have a small yard at the printing factory with no big jams
Jul 28 11:11:12,3,4,yes indeed

Jul 28 11:14:24,3,4,Oh no it's enough you know ;)
