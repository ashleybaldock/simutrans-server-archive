Aug  8 06:14:00,2,2,hi
Aug  8 06:14:27,3,3,g'day
Aug  8 06:15:37,3,3,i am working on some rules for multiplayer
Aug  8 06:15:48,2,2,Oh can help you ?
Aug  8 06:16:49,3,3,i will write down my current thoughts and maybe start a forum thread
Aug  8 06:16:54,2,2,ok
Aug  8 06:18:32,3,3,i thought of some more since yesterday
Aug  8 06:18:46,3,3,"283,224"
Aug  8 06:19:06,2,2,...
Aug  8 06:19:08,3,3,plauer blocked the road with loading bays
Aug  8 06:19:15,2,2,sephiroth...
Aug  8 06:21:18,2,2,"or maybe not, ceske is a czech word no ?"
Aug  8 06:23:33,3,3,i believe so
Aug  8 06:24:19,3,3,many players will have to adjust to not being the only player on the map
Aug  8 06:24:29,2,2,indeed
Aug  8 06:24:45,3,3,i believe this is what occurred here
Aug  8 06:24:59,2,2,I hope so ;)
Aug  8 06:25:21,3,3,an example of a where a rule should be set not so much to stop idiots
Aug  8 06:25:36,3,3,but to remind people of how multiplayer must work
Aug  8 06:25:42,2,2,yes
Aug  8 06:27:01,3,3,"another example is 274,242"
Aug  8 06:27:33,3,3,3 minutes after i built this bridge Alliance asked me to destroy it and make it longer
Aug  8 06:27:43,3,3,because one day he might want to put double track
Aug  8 06:28:25,3,3,we need to have a way of resolving these things so that players do not have to build infrastructure they don't need
Aug  8 06:28:35,2,2,indeed
Aug  8 06:28:49,3,3,and also so that players don't have to destroy things unnecessarily
Aug  8 06:30:32,2,2,"331,242 should be not allowed too, I think it's an abuse of the map"
Aug  8 06:31:49,3,3,whereas i think that's ok!
Aug  8 06:32:03,2,2,ok
Aug  8 06:32:12,3,3,it looks ok and does not block shipping
Aug  8 06:32:21,3,3,it is realistic
Aug  8 06:32:38,2,2,"ok, but on a longer distance ?"
Aug  8 06:32:42,3,3,if it lengthened the journey for shipping maybe
Aug  8 06:33:12,3,3,the question here is whether the bridge is justified
Aug  8 06:33:27,3,3,how much distance does it save
Aug  8 06:33:39,2,2,ok
Aug  8 06:34:07,3,3,i didn't realise that was a lake
Aug  8 06:34:24,3,3,as it is a lake i might say it sbould be banned
Aug  8 06:34:51,3,3,"if it was an estuary and it bridged a river to save many km, then it is ok"
Aug  8 06:35:13,2,2,indeed

Aug  8 08:37:23,2,2,your post resume very good all we need :)
Aug  8 08:46:38,2,2,but you may add: only one company per player
Aug  8 08:50:58,4,3,"hi G, yes, i forgot that one, you can reply with that"
Aug  8 08:51:11,2,2,Oh no
Aug  8 08:51:15,2,2,just edit
Aug  8 08:51:38,4,3,"no, you add, and say you agree with all the proposed rules"
Aug  8 08:51:43,2,2,I don't want to make it ugly to read ( several posts...)
Aug  8 08:51:54,2,2,ok ;)
Aug  8 08:51:58,4,3,as some existing players may not agree with some of the rules
Aug  8 08:52:08,2,2,ok I 'll agree
Aug  8 08:52:13,4,3,once we have a final set we put them in a sticky
Aug  8 08:52:19,2,2,ok
Aug  8 08:53:20,2,2,we can add that players who don't want to respect it can join the second 128 server ?
Aug  8 08:53:41,4,3,that doesn't need to go in these rules
Aug  8 08:53:45,2,2,ok
Aug  8 08:53:50,4,3,but that is what we can remind anyone
Aug  8 08:54:06,4,3,we could put that in a sign on the map at the opening

Aug  8 09:08:47,4,3,"hmm, i'd like to think that was obvious"
Aug  8 09:09:19,4,3,but we have in there that the public player can delete anything that consumes space
Aug  8 09:09:31,4,3,and also to obey instructions from the public player
Aug  8 09:10:19,4,3,if we don't mention graffiti maybe people won't get the idea to make it

Aug  8 11:44:08,3,3,can we do a quick server test?
Aug  8 11:44:13,2,2,Did I well answer vonjo ?
Aug  8 11:44:36,2,2,what test ?
Aug  8 11:44:37,3,3,i will PM you my IP address and you can connect to my server game and test the upload speed
Aug  8 11:44:44,2,2,ok
Aug  8 11:45:30,3,3,done
Aug  8 11:45:41,2,2,I tet it now

Aug  8 11:47:20,3,3,"vonjo raised some good questions, he is right that we should outline the job of the moderators"
Aug  8 11:47:35,3,3,especially as more than one person will be doing the job
Aug  8 11:48:00,3,3,i wonder if the firewall will stop you connecting...

Aug  8 11:49:00,2,2,I can't
Aug  8 11:49:15,3,3,did it say no response?

Aug  8 11:49:36,3,3,"ok, i will try a different firewall setting"

Aug  8 11:57:39,2,2,ok
Aug  8 11:57:54,2,2,that's not a problem 
Aug  8 11:57:58,3,3,i can join the game from another machine here using local ip address
Aug  8 11:58:06,2,2,ok
Aug  8 11:58:14,3,3,but i can't join using the external ip address
Aug  8 11:58:48,3,3,maybe you can give it another try just in case
Aug  8 11:58:59,3,3,i specified the port
Aug  8 11:59:06,2,2,which one ?
Aug  8 11:59:17,3,3,i have just changed the gateway firewall settings
Aug  8 11:59:17,2,2,"here "":13354"""
Aug  8 11:59:23,3,3,same ip address i just sent you
Aug  8 11:59:50,3,3,does the port name need to go on the ip address?
Aug  8 12:00:03,2,2,don't know but we can try :)
Aug  8 12:00:25,3,3,to join locally i just use the ip address
Aug  8 12:00:45,3,3,the port is set when starting the server game
Aug  8 12:00:51,2,2,"Maybe by using hamachi, do you know hamachi ?"
Aug  8 12:01:18,3,3,never heard of it
Aug  8 12:01:36,2,2,it's program to connect two or more computer by direct tunnels
Aug  8 12:02:00,2,2,to make a local system through internet
Aug  8 12:02:15,2,2,very useful for games
Aug  8 12:02:36,3,3,is a freeware program?
Aug  8 12:02:46,2,2,yes
Aug  8 12:03:08,2,2,you should read a description in internet
Aug  8 12:03:37,3,3,looking now
Aug  8 12:03:45,2,2,ok
Aug  8 12:03:55,2,2,I can test it with you if you want
Aug  8 12:05:39,2,2,Don't worry I don't want to send you a virus or sometthing else ;)
Aug  8 12:05:56,3,3,"i just found some server info about the router here, i will check that out first"
Aug  8 12:06:07,2,2,ok

Aug  8 12:31:33,2,2,"Indeed you're making me some ideas too, I'm losting time here..."
Aug  8 12:31:41,4,11,Ok fixed that stuck

Aug  8 12:44:30,3,3,the destination is 12 tiles in size

Aug  8 12:45:17,2,2,yes ceske
Aug  8 12:45:48,3,3,none of the stations is well utilised
Aug  8 12:45:56,3,3,"like you say G, one public stop"

Aug  8 12:47:09,2,2,all the barriers are useless...

Aug  8 13:12:58,6,3,g'day 50
Aug  8 13:13:12,2,12,hello moblet
Aug  8 13:13:36,2,12,any news from timothy? I see that he has been active on the forum today
Aug  8 13:13:53,6,3,none yet
Aug  8 13:14:13,6,3,being online and getting to his server are not the same thing
Aug  8 13:14:30,2,12,"of course, just thought maybe you got a response"
Aug  8 13:14:42,0,255,Right now 4 clients are connected.
Aug  8 13:15:02,0,255,Right now 5 clients are connected.
Aug  8 13:15:33,2,12,"I think your rules are a bit overcomplicated, moblet"
Aug  8 13:15:56,6,3,have you had a look around this map? :)
Aug  8 13:16:17,2,12,I think we can do more with less moblet
Aug  8 13:16:25,2,12,yes this map is bad
Aug  8 13:16:44,2,12,partially because all the industries are in one place
Aug  8 13:16:50,6,3,"if we can do more with less, great"
Aug  8 13:16:53,2,12,and the powerlines are not public
Aug  8 13:16:59,6,3,i agree they make heavy reading
Aug  8 13:17:23,2,12,You have to cater to some players who are not native english speakers too
Aug  8 13:17:54,6,3,"we have users who can translate, that's not a big deal"
Aug  8 13:18:23,6,3,"the rules would sit on the forum, not in signs in the game"
Aug  8 13:18:43,6,3,but we do need to make them as simple and concise as possible
Aug  8 13:19:03,2,12,Why can't hubs/airports be directly connected to factories?
Aug  8 13:19:27,6,3,"they can, they just can't take up lots of space next to them"
Aug  8 13:20:03,2,12,Oh ok. I try to make a concise version on the forum in a minute
Aug  8 13:20:09,6,3,both use large land area
Aug  8 13:20:23,6,3,"also, flying everything everywhere is not terribly realistic"
Aug  8 13:20:33,6,3,every rule in there is based on experience
Aug  8 13:20:45,6,3,and is there for a reason
Aug  8 13:21:20,2,12,"I also know from experiance that the more rules there are, the more likely they are to get broken"
Aug  8 13:21:58,6,3,and it gets complicated because we have to balance the rights of players who want access with the rights of players who already have it
Aug  8 13:22:21,2,12,"One thing I always try to do is to leave a space for a double track like at 75, 77"
Aug  8 13:23:21,6,3,and i would say don't bother
Aug  8 13:23:28,6,3,negotiate it later
Aug  8 13:23:42,6,3,because we don't know how the map will develop
Aug  8 13:24:03,0,255,Right now 4 clients are connected.
Aug  8 13:24:23,0,255,Right now 5 clients are connected.
Aug  8 13:24:43,6,3,it's important that we establish a culture of negotiating and sharing space
Aug  8 13:24:51,2,12,Yes
Aug  8 13:24:55,6,3,otherwise everyone builds stuff just to claim space
Aug  8 13:25:57,2,12,Airplaines will be needed the way I designed industries from the outset in the Swiss mao
Aug  8 13:26:00,2,12,map
Aug  8 13:26:08,3,2,yes
Aug  8 13:26:15,6,3,that culture should extend to communicating with the other player before building close to them
Aug  8 13:26:50,6,3,"fine, but we don't want three players building three airports at each factory"
Aug  8 13:27:05,0,255,Right now 6 clients are connected.
Aug  8 13:27:18,6,3,build one airport in a good location and truck to it
Aug  8 13:27:41,6,3,maybe even make it public
Aug  8 13:27:49,2,12,Right.
Aug  8 13:27:55,6,3,i don't think planes will be needed in the swiss map
Aug  8 13:28:09,6,3,we certainly don't want to be flying coal and iron
Aug  8 13:28:15,3,2,And it can't
Aug  8 13:28:22,3,2,no airplanes for that I think
Aug  8 13:28:31,2,12,Yes they will. Look at the electronics and brewery industries
Aug  8 13:28:44,2,12,Only Boxed goods and cooled goods
Aug  8 13:29:01,5,9,HF
Aug  8 13:29:10,6,3,they can still be moved by land at a profit
Aug  8 13:29:23,5,9,godd morning guys!!!
Aug  8 13:29:31,3,2,hi
Aug  8 13:29:37,4,11,hello
Aug  8 13:29:39,6,3,g'day
Aug  8 13:29:48,7,10,Hi.
Aug  8 13:29:51,2,12,"From the outset, building an airport is often cheaper and prevents rail spaghetti"
Aug  8 13:30:24,6,3,"no problem with using planes per se, but we don't want airports to be as common as railway stations"
Aug  8 13:30:42,2,12,"right, they won't"
Aug  8 13:30:48,4,11,"like 217,107?"
Aug  8 13:30:58,6,3,they will if we don't rule against building them next to factories
Aug  8 13:31:26,6,3,and building them in cities
Aug  8 13:32:04,2,12,Maybe we should discuss one thing alliance and I like to do with planes...
Aug  8 13:32:28,2,12,Build artificial islands in the sea for fish movement
Aug  8 13:33:04,3,2,or trains for petrol in seas
Aug  8 13:33:21,0,255,Right now 5 clients are connected.
Aug  8 13:33:24,2,12,Or electrifying oil rigs
Aug  8 13:33:37,0,255,Right now 6 clients are connected.
Aug  8 13:34:00,6,3,"yes, the ban on bridges should also say causeways"
Aug  8 13:34:12,2,12,My view on oil trains to the sea is small distances is okay (see my rig)
Aug  8 13:34:21,6,3,we can set a tile limit
Aug  8 13:34:34,3,2,"98,13 should be forbidden"
Aug  8 13:34:37,6,3,"but personally, if it's an oil rig it shouldn't be served by a train"
Aug  8 13:34:59,6,3,or any land based transport
Aug  8 13:35:07,2,12,I think powerlines look very tacky though
Aug  8 13:35:10,6,3,it's a deep sea operation by defintion
Aug  8 13:35:22,4,11,"true, 96,11 is really abusive"
Aug  8 13:36:07,6,3,the reason an oil rig is built is because the sea is too deep to build a causeway
Aug  8 13:36:34,6,3,IRl i mean
Aug  8 13:36:39,2,12,"IRL, yes. But in Simutrans sometimes they are close to shore"
Aug  8 13:36:50,6,3,IRL sometimes they are close to shore
Aug  8 13:37:08,6,3,but we can set a tile limit

Aug  8 13:39:06,6,3,"if you want simple rules though, we don't have a tile limit, we have a simple ban"
Aug  8 13:39:25,6,3,i would much prefer a simple ban
Aug  8 13:39:27,0,255,Right now 5 clients are connected.
Aug  8 13:39:30,3,2,me too
Aug  8 13:40:00,6,3,my complicated airports rule could be made much simpler by banning airfreight altogether
Aug  8 13:40:00,2,12,"if you think so, then ok"
Aug  8 13:40:22,3,2,I agree
Aug  8 13:40:25,2,12,"No, we need airfreight, I say just not in cities or short distances"
Aug  8 13:40:25,6,3,"which i would prefer, but i know some like to airfreight a lot"
Aug  8 13:40:37,3,2,But on the swiss map 
Aug  8 13:40:38,6,3,"""short distances"" becomes complicated"
Aug  8 13:40:56,3,2,We can make rules map by map
Aug  8 13:41:08,6,3,so long as we don't lose track of them!
Aug  8 13:41:42,6,3,"it should never be essential, unavoidable, to airfreight"
Aug  8 13:41:56,6,3,"most profitable maybe, but not essential"
Aug  8 13:41:59,2,12,"Speedbus/Woody, I need 25 MW for my glass mill at 2, 154"
Aug  8 13:42:23,2,12,"and i have a windmill with 27 mw at 441, 212"
Aug  8 13:42:51,2,12,would you mind connecting the two so I dont need to build a big duplicate powerline?
Aug  8 13:43:18,7,10,Work in progress.
Aug  8 13:43:34,2,12,Thanks muchly
Aug  8 13:44:22,2,12,agree airfreight should not be essential
Aug  8 13:44:51,2,12,you *can* complete every chain without it but definetly some routes are well suited to it
Aug  8 13:44:56,6,3,if we are going to allow it then we need to force it to be done in realistic fashion
Aug  8 13:45:23,3,2,We can say that airports can only done by admins in some conditions
Aug  8 13:45:24,6,3,which gives us the problem of having a complicated rule
Aug  8 13:46:21,6,3,"yes, we could make airports the domain of the public player"
Aug  8 13:46:42,6,3,except that the public player will have a conflict of interest if they are also a private player
Aug  8 13:46:58,3,2,so another admin will answer
Aug  8 13:47:08,2,12,"Yes. And I want to be playing, not administrating tbh"
Aug  8 13:47:33,6,3,"one option then is that if a map is designed for airfreight, build the airports into the savegame"
Aug  8 13:47:36,3,2,We can do both
Aug  8 13:47:47,3,2,good idea indeed
Aug  8 13:47:57,6,3,"and then say no one can build more airports, for freight at least"
Aug  8 13:48:15,3,2,that's better indeed
Aug  8 13:48:41,2,12,I don't know. Things always need to be bigger if many players use them.
Aug  8 13:48:52,6,3,an airport can only have 2 runways anyway
Aug  8 13:49:00,2,12,I can build most airports in 9 tiles for a lot of private traffic
Aug  8 13:49:05,6,3,then it's just a matter of adding stops to it
Aug  8 13:49:20,3,2,so there's no problem
Aug  8 13:49:21,6,3,but a big public airport is a much better outcome than 3-4 little private ones
Aug  8 13:49:58,2,12,"IMO, each place aifrieght is needed on the map, it would be used by one player only"
Aug  8 13:50:28,6,3,"well we shouldn't see airfreight as door to door, that only happens in the illegal drug trade"
Aug  8 13:50:30,3,2,"No, at a strategic point, several players can use it"
Aug  8 13:50:36,6,3,it's hub to hub
Aug  8 13:51:52,3,2,"one more question : It will be difficult to control the number of airplaneso of each one, espacially if only one is needed"
Aug  8 13:51:54,2,12,"We can see what happens as the game progresses. As it does, airfreight should be big at the beginning and end, not very important in the middle"
Aug  8 13:52:15,0,255,Right now 4 clients are connected.
Aug  8 13:52:32,0,255,Right now 5 clients are connected.
Aug  8 13:52:52,5,3,i agree we will have to try it and see
Aug  8 13:53:07,5,3,but some current airfreight habits here are not acceptable as far as i am concerned
Aug  8 13:53:26,2,12,Alliance does go a little crazy sometimes
Aug  8 13:53:31,3,2,yes
Aug  8 13:53:55,5,3,"and i would like to see it happen in a realistic fashion, i.e. an airport is a hub"
Aug  8 13:54:07,0,255,Right now 4 clients are connected.
Aug  8 13:54:14,2,12,"G, can I use some of your roads to serve the textile plant?"
Aug  8 13:54:27,0,255,Right now 5 clients are connected.
Aug  8 13:54:30,3,2,no problem ;)
Aug  8 13:55:06,2,12,"hmm, can you remove the ship depot at 87, 295"
Aug  8 13:55:23,5,3,"so my rule tries to force the airport to be a hub, if there is a simpler way to do that let's hear it"
Aug  8 13:55:41,3,2,ok
Aug  8 13:57:10,5,3,"i guess if we design maps with population concentrated at one end, and put the high value factories near the population, we reduce demand for airfright, right?"
Aug  8 13:57:40,5,3,*airfreight!
Aug  8 13:57:47,3,2,yes
Aug  8 13:57:55,2,12,Most of the high value industries are nearby
Aug  8 13:58:15,2,12,Northwest and southeast have high value
Aug  8 13:58:32,2,12,central band from northeast to southwest has high volume
Aug  8 13:58:38,5,3,what was high value in southeast? plastic?
Aug  8 13:58:44,2,12,Food
Aug  8 13:58:52,5,3,ah
Aug  8 13:59:43,2,12,"I can envision two big freight railways, one centered on each high value area and connecting and linking the middle in between"
Aug  8 14:00:06,2,12,And another company or two to do smaller hauling
Aug  8 14:00:24,5,3,i'm really curious to see how the map develops
Aug  8 14:01:06,5,3,for future maps what config parameters should we be reviewing?
Aug  8 14:01:06,2,12,"Yes, and It will probably be differnet than the industry planner thinks :)"

Aug  8 14:01:33,2,12,typos galore
Aug  8 14:01:45,3,2,what ?
Aug  8 14:01:46,2,12,industry_increase_every
Aug  8 14:01:46,5,3,"all perfectly understandable, don't worry"
Aug  8 14:02:05,2,12,I think 128 default is 4000
Aug  8 14:02:10,3,2,5000
Aug  8 14:02:12,5,3,it's clear from watching this game that we don't all think the same way about the tasks
Aug  8 14:02:56,2,12,"5000, okay. maybe move somewhere between 6000-8000"
Aug  8 14:03:24,3,2,indeed
Aug  8 14:03:41,3,2,and admins can remove some of them if it's creating problems
Aug  8 14:03:49,2,12,Yes
Aug  8 14:04:00,5,3,"that's the industry increase one, yes?"
Aug  8 14:04:05,3,2,yes
Aug  8 14:04:12,3,2,for a chain
Aug  8 14:04:54,5,3,"then we also have population growth factors, G and I want to reduce growth rates"
Aug  8 14:05:50,3,2,"yes, it is when you start a map"
Aug  8 14:05:54,5,3,as public transit is too dynamic to manage
Aug  8 14:06:08,3,2,"for village, small city, and big city"
Aug  8 14:06:28,3,2,don't know anymore the real names of it ;)
Aug  8 14:06:31,5,3,i would like to greatly reduce these rates since they grow when we are not here
Aug  8 14:06:40,3,2,yes
Aug  8 14:06:47,3,2,for the big cities
Aug  8 14:06:48,5,3,unlike in single player
Aug  8 14:06:58,5,3,villages: 400
Aug  8 14:06:59,3,2,but villages needs big growth
Aug  8 14:07:08,5,3,cities: 200
Aug  8 14:07:13,5,3,capitals: 100
Aug  8 14:07:21,2,12,"yes, that one you can adjust from the simuconf page in game"
Aug  8 14:07:38,5,3,i am not sure how these numbers are computed but i read that higher numbers give lower growth
Aug  8 14:07:38,3,2,"making capitals to 50, cities to 150 and villages to 400 no ?"
Aug  8 14:07:46,3,2,ah
Aug  8 14:08:10,5,3,at 10000 growth is zero from what i read
Aug  8 14:08:19,3,2,ok
Aug  8 14:08:24,2,12,"Speedbus, are you farmiliar with the growth settings?"
Aug  8 14:08:28,3,2,so the big city growh faster ?
Aug  8 14:08:42,2,12,One idea instead is to reduce the passenger_factor 
Aug  8 14:08:54,3,2,oh no
Aug  8 14:08:57,5,3,"no, we need to reduce the rate of sprawl"
Aug  8 14:09:02,3,2,It si not high...
Aug  8 14:09:04,5,3,it makes us change our routes
Aug  8 14:09:34,2,12,"okay, I usually do frieght, I'll leave it to you"
Aug  8 14:09:56,5,3,"yes, i just don't know how the numbers are computed, will have to ask on the forum"
Aug  8 14:09:59,3,2,I'd like to make also freight ;)
Aug  8 14:10:16,2,12,simuconf is pretty well commented
Aug  8 14:10:22,5,3,"not just for us, pax needs to be manageable for anyone"
Aug  8 14:10:36,3,2,indeed
Aug  8 14:10:54,5,3,and of course reducing population growth will also reduce industry growth
Aug  8 14:10:58,2,12,"I can't manage pax very well, GAC, you played that one 128 game I did pax right?"
Aug  8 14:11:46,3,2,I did passengers of the other map yes but not all ;)
Aug  8 14:12:09,2,12,You might want to try a few test games with just a few cities and see how they grow
Aug  8 14:12:12,5,3,config doesn't even say whether higher or lower values increase growth
Aug  8 14:12:21,5,3,"yes, might have to do that"
Aug  8 14:12:23,2,12,before comitting to a setting for a big game
Aug  8 14:12:32,0,255,Right now 4 clients are connected.
Aug  8 14:12:55,5,3,"i searched the forum but didn't learn much, maybe i should try to find it in the code"
Aug  8 14:13:09,2,12,"Oh, I thought you were also on the map before that where I did pax"
Aug  8 14:13:27,3,2,no
Aug  8 14:13:38,2,12,"If its not in simuconf, the code will not help you"

Aug  8 14:13:58,3,2,"ok, I'll test it"
Aug  8 14:14:05,5,3,"the values are there, but the comments don't help, in the code i may see the actual calcs"
Aug  8 14:14:32,2,12,good luck with the code and its german abbreviations
Aug  8 14:14:54,5,3,"yes, looking in the code always ends up being harder than i imagined"

Aug  8 14:23:35,2,12,I don't think they have realized multiple trains can share a line
Aug  8 14:23:36,3,3,"of course, i forgot that in single player you can fast-forward"
Aug  8 14:24:54,3,3,"they are not the same player, they have just clambered over each other in unco-ordinated fashion"
Aug  8 14:25:31,2,12,I am certain both are sepiroth
Aug  8 14:25:55,3,3,has sephiroth ever used signals?
Aug  8 14:26:38,2,12,there is no signal on that line
Aug  8 14:27:16,3,3,the other parameter i was wondering about is in routing
Aug  8 14:27:26,3,3,no_routing_over_overcrowded
Aug  8 14:27:36,3,3,is a binary
Aug  8 14:27:37,2,12,bad idea
Aug  8 14:28:08,2,12,Stations will get overcrowded in a netgame. No way to control it
Aug  8 14:28:34,3,3,well i was thinking in terms of other players joining in to serve journeys
Aug  8 14:28:39,2,12,"Sorry, that sounded sort of pushy :)"

Aug  8 14:29:31,0,255,Right now 3 clients are connected.
Aug  8 14:30:17,3,3,would that parameter make any difference if another player tried to move passengers from someone else's network?
Aug  8 14:30:33,2,12,what do you mean by that?
Aug  8 14:30:48,3,3,i mean let's say someone is moving pax but not coping
Aug  8 14:30:57,3,3,and their stations are overcrowded severely
Aug  8 14:31:17,3,3,what happens if another player tries to also serve that demand?
Aug  8 14:31:52,2,12,It would do little if the stations are not public
Aug  8 14:32:27,3,3,i was wondering if this parameter would make any difference to the choices made by future pax
Aug  8 14:32:44,2,12,I really don't like it if I am serving a city and someone else comes in and duplicates bus routes
Aug  8 14:32:58,3,3,in a moderated game that wouldn't happen
Aug  8 14:33:11,2,12,"right, then what's the point?"
Aug  8 14:33:23,3,3,the point is bringing in another player to help move the pax
Aug  8 14:33:58,2,12,Either the player would build new bus stops = bad idea or
Aug  8 14:34:30,2,12,"the station would have to be public, and if it is crowded then the parameter would do nothing"
Aug  8 14:34:40,3,3,i guess if we made the stops public the pax would get on the next vehicle going no matter whose it was
Aug  8 14:35:21,2,12,yes.
Aug  8 14:35:24,3,3,i was thinking if the 2nd player's route was less direct the pax would just sit there
Aug  8 14:35:31,2,12,no
Aug  8 14:36:03,3,3,they would take it anyway?
Aug  8 14:36:51,2,12,If there are multiple routes between two of the same stations pax will take whichever comes first
Aug  8 14:36:58,3,3,"ah, good"
Aug  8 14:37:08,3,3,"next param, max_transfers"
Aug  8 14:37:12,2,12,even if they would get there faster by wating for the next train
Aug  8 14:37:23,3,3,"default in 128 is 7, is that high enough?"
Aug  8 14:37:23,2,12,leave as is
Aug  8 14:38:07,2,12,"every other transfer adds more cpu time, we don't want to stress timothy's server"
Aug  8 14:38:38,3,3,"yeah, i was worried about that, we may want to remind players of the limit when building their networks"
Aug  8 14:40:03,3,3,"ok, so i'll wait for G to figure out what growth values to try"
Aug  8 14:40:35,2,12,I think it is sort of guess and check
Aug  8 14:40:46,3,3,that's what he's doing now
Aug  8 14:41:12,3,3,the poland map naturally lends itself to a pattern

Aug  8 14:42:22,3,3,contrasted with low population but high resource concentration inland
Aug  8 14:42:38,3,3,along with hillier terrain
Aug  8 14:43:37,3,3,"that may or may not be how it actually is in poland, but i'm curious to build a map like that and see how it plays"
Aug  8 14:44:09,2,12,yes
Aug  8 14:45:51,3,3,you can do the industries again if you like :)
Aug  8 14:46:28,2,12,I don't feel like doing that again untill we play the swiss map a few times
Aug  8 14:46:45,3,3,"no, you really killed yourself on that one!"
Aug  8 14:47:05,3,3,plus we have to learn from the swiss play
Aug  8 14:47:16,2,12,exactly

Aug  8 14:50:04,4,2,"Ok, for 1 cities grow very very fast , 10000 almost no growth"
Aug  8 14:50:54,3,3,so we just have to find out what values are best for us...

Aug  8 14:51:14,0,255,Right now 4 clients are connected.
Aug  8 14:51:46,2,12,build a simple test with 2-3 cities and normal growth factors
Aug  8 14:52:05,2,12,"fast forward, see how much it grows in a year"
Aug  8 14:52:51,2,12,then you move settings untill you only have 2/3 or some amount of the growth
